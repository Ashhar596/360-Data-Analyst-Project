# 360-Data-Analyst-Project
In this project, I made a Ola Analysis Project with the help of Excel, SQL, and Power BI to create a 360 Project that transforms raw data into actionable insights.
Ola Data Analysis Project

Project Overview

I made a Ola Analysis Project which focuses on analyzing data from Ola, a leading ride-hailing platform. The analysis aims to uncover insights into various aspects of the business, including overall performance, vehicle type preferences, revenue generation, cancellation trends, and customer ratings. By leveraging tools like Excel, SQL, and Power BI, I have created an end-to-end solution to process, analyze, and visualize the data effectively.

Objectives

Overall Analysis: Understanding the broader performance metrics and trends of the Ola platform.

Vehicle Type Analysis: Evaluating the usage patterns and popularity of different vehicle types.

Revenue Analysis: Identifying revenue trends and determining the most profitable areas.

Cancellation Analysis: Analyzing ride cancellation rates and identifying potential reasons.

Ratings Analysis: Assessing customer feedback through ratings to improve service quality.

Tools and Technologies Used

Excel: For initial data inspection, cleaning, and basic analysis.

SQL: To perform complex queries for filtering, aggregating, and transforming the data.

Power BI: For creating interactive and dynamic dashboards to visualize key findings.

Project Workflow

Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Inspected and cleaned the raw data using Excel to ensure consistency and accuracy.

Addressed missing values and removed duplicates to prepare the dataset for analysis.

Data Analysis with SQL:

Performed in-depth analysis using SQL queries.

Used advanced techniques like joins, window functions, and subqueries to analyze:

Overall trends and patterns.

Vehicle type usage and preferences.

Revenue distribution and growth areas.

Cancellation patterns and contributing factors.

Customer ratings and feedback trends.

Data Visualization with Power BI:

Designed interactive dashboards to present key metrics and insights visually.

Implemented slicers, filters, and drill-downs to allow dynamic exploration of the data.

Key Insights

Overall Performance: Identified significant growth trends and high-demand periods.

Vehicle Types: Highlighted the most popular vehicle categories and their contribution to revenue.

Revenue Trends: Pinpointed peak revenue periods and top-performing locations.

Cancellation Trends: Found major reasons for cancellations and high-cancellation zones.

Ratings Analysis: Uncovered areas for improvement based on customer feedback.

Project Outcomes

Delivered actionable insights to optimize vehicle allocation, revenue strategies, and customer experience.

Identified operational bottlenecks and areas for service improvement.

Created an interactive dashboard enabling stakeholders to explore insights dynamically.
